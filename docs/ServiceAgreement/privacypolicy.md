## 1. What Personal Information Do We Collect?

1.1 Personal information refers to any information recorded electronically or otherwise that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.

1.2 When you purchase or use Neolink.AI products and services through the Neolink.AI website (especially by logging into the console), we collect and use the following personal information:

**(1) Registration Information.** When registering an account on Neolink.AI, you must provide a username, phone number, and create a password. Your phone number is required for account registration, binding, and receiving notifications such as verification codes (e.g., password recovery) and business-related updates (e.g., new products, events, service changes). After registration, you can choose to provide additional information such as your real name, industry, location, website, address, and email in the console.  
If you do not register, you can still browse public Neolink.AI pages or product introductions, but you cannot access further services provided by Neolink.AI.

**(2) Authentication Information.** In accordance with China's Cybersecurity Law, you must complete identity verification before purchasing or using Neolink.AI products or services. This includes providing your **name, identification document (ID card or passport), facial information, and bank card number** for identity verification. These services may be facilitated by a third-party provider (e.g., Baidu). **Facial information and bank card numbers are classified as sensitive personal information. You may refuse to provide them, but failure to do so will prevent you from completing the authentication process.** Users outside mainland China usually only need to provide an email address for registration unless choosing to register with a phone number.

**(3) Filing Service Information.** For specific services (e.g., filing services), additional information such as the **name, ID, phone number, email, domain certificate, and filing photos** of the entity or website administrator may be required. Failure to provide this information may prevent access to specific services, but it will not affect access to basic products or services.

**(4) Log Information.** We collect your **ID, IP address, browser type, language settings, device details, operating system version, network provider, and service access dates, times, and durations** to provide and monitor cloud service operations.

**(5) Customer Service Information.** For customer service, we may require your **UID, username**, or other identity-verifying details. You will also need to provide your **last name and phone number** for feedback on your service requests. We may retain your chat history and order information to provide the services you request. If creating a new message recipient, you must provide the recipientâ€™s **name, email, and phone number**.

**(6) Operational and Support Information.** For new services and promotions, we may collect your **contact information (e.g., phone number), address, and transaction account information** through promotion interfaces to facilitate participation. If you do not participate in these activities, this information is not required.

**(7) Payment Information.** Depending on the service agreement, you may need to provide **payment details (e.g., WeChat, Alipay, or bank card), tax ID, and VAT number**. We may share your name and bank card number with third-party banks for payment processing.

**(8) Invoice Recipient Information.** For invoice delivery, we may collect **recipient name, phone number, region, address, and postal code**.

**(9) Additional Information.** Neolink.AI may collect any other personal information you authorize us to collect. We will obtain your consent before collecting this information.
