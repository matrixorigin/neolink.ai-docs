You can refer to the API documentation to learn how to call our large model APIs.

## Introduction

You can interact with our large model APIs through HTTP requests in any programming language, such as for conversation completion and embedding types.

## Authentication

Authentication is performed using API Keys. You can create API Keys in the following interface. All API requests must include the `Authorization` field in the request headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_API_KEY
```
