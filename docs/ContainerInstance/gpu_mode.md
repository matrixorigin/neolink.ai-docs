When using built-in tools such as ComfyUI, these operations require GPU resources to ensure efficient model performance and fast response times. In such cases, it is recommended to select GPU Mode (i.e., enable GPU usage) to fully utilize the computational power of the graphics card, enhancing processing speed and performance. Once GPU Mode is selected, the system will automatically allocate available GPUs for computation, making it suitable for resource-intensive tasks such as model inference and image generation.
