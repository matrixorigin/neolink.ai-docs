For tasks such as writing and debugging code, uploading or downloading data to the instance, or presenting code that do not require GPU usage, you can choose to start the instance in GPU-less Mode. In GPU-less Mode, the instance will use a 2-core CPU and 4GB of memory without a GPU. The cost for this mode is Â¥0.1/hour. Switching to GPU-less Mode will not affect your instance data before or after use, and you can still switch back to normal mode from the instance list for regular operations such as powering on and off.

## Starting in GPU-less Mode
